// NOTE: Deployment Strategies for Go Applications
/*
	Deploying Go applications can vary based on the type of application (e.g., web server, CLI tool, etc.)
	and the environment in which you are deploying (e.g., cloud services, on-premises servers, containers).
	Here are some common strategies
*/

// NOTE: 1. Static Binaries
/*
	One of the key advantages of Go is its ability to compile to a single static binary. This makes deployment straightforward:
		•	Build the Binary: Compile your application into a binary using go build.
		•	Transfer the Binary: Copy the binary to your server or target environment.
		•	Run the Binary: Execute the binary directly, e.g., ./myapp.

	This method is efficient since it eliminates dependencies and allows for easy versioning.
*/

// NOTE: 2. Docker Containers
/*
	Using Docker to containerize your Go application is a popular approach for deployment, as it provides consistency across environments.

	Steps to Dockerize a Go Application:
	1.	Create a Dockerfile:
	```Dockerfile
		# Use the official Golang image to build the binary
		FROM golang:1.16 AS builder

		WORKDIR /app
		COPY . .

		RUN go build -o myapp

		# Use a minimal base image to run the binary
		FROM alpine:latest
		COPY --from=builder /app/myapp .

		CMD ["./myapp"]
	```

	2.	Build the Docker Image:
	```bash
	docker build -t myapp .
	```

	3.	Run the Docker Container:
	```bash
	docker run -p 8080:8080 myapp
	```
*/

// NOTE: 3. Cloud Deployment
/*
	Cloud platforms like AWS, Google Cloud, and Azure offer services for deploying Go applications. Common approaches include:
		•	Elastic Beanstalk (AWS): You can deploy Go applications using Elastic Beanstalk, which handles scaling and load balancing.
		•	Google Cloud Run: Deploy your Go applications as containers in a serverless environment.
		•	Kubernetes: If you’re deploying microservices, consider using Kubernetes for orchestration.
			You can define your Go application in a Kubernetes Deployment and expose it via a Service.
*/

// NOTE: 4. Continuous Deployment (CD)
/*
	Implementing CI/CD pipelines allows for automated testing and deployment:
		•	GitHub Actions: Set up workflows to build, test, and deploy your Go application whenever you push to your repository.
		•	GitLab CI/CD: Define pipelines in your .gitlab-ci.yml file to manage the build and deployment processes.
*/

// NOTE: 5. Environment Configuration
/*
	When deploying applications, manage environment variables for configuration settings (e.g., database connections, API keys):
		•	Using .env files: Load environment variables using libraries like godotenv.
		•	Directly in Docker: Pass environment variables when running a container using the -e flag.
*/

// NOTE: Key Takeaways:
/*
	•	Static Binaries: Compile your Go application into a single binary for straightforward deployment.
	•	Docker Containers: Use Docker to containerize your application for consistent environments.
	•	Cloud Deployment: Utilize services like AWS, Google Cloud, and Azure for scalable deployments.
	•	Continuous Deployment: Implement CI/CD pipelines for automated testing and deployment.
	•	Environment Configuration: Manage configurations through environment variables.

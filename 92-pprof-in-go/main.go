// NOTE: pprof
/*
	pprof in Go is a performance profiling tool included in the Go programming language's
	standard library.
	It helps developers analyze the performance and resource usage of their applications,
	such as CPU, memory, goroutines, and more.

	Here’s a breakdown of what pprof is and how it’s used:
*/

// NOTE: Key Features of pprof:
/*
	Profiling CPU Usage: It records the CPU time consumed by your application, showing where
	the program spends the most processing time.

	Memory Profiling: It helps track heap allocations, identifying which parts of your code
	use the most memory.

	Goroutine Profiling: It shows the state and stack traces of all goroutines, helping
	diagnose issues like goroutine leaks or deadlocks.

	Block and Mutex Profiling: It tracks blocking operations or mutex contention, helping
	identify performance bottlenecks in concurrency.

	Visualization: pprof can generate detailed visualizations, such as flame graphs or call
	graphs, to represent resource usage.
*/

// NOTE: How to Use pprof in Go:
/*
	1. Import the Package:
		```go
		import _ "net/http/pprof"
		```
	This package registers handlers under the /debug/pprof/ endpoint when your program runs an
	HTTP server.

	2. Start an HTTP Server: You need to run an HTTP server so you can access the profiling
	   data via the /debug/pprof endpoint:
		```
		import (
			"net/http"
			_ "net/http/pprof"
		)

		func main() {
			go func() {
				log.Println(http.ListenAndServe("localhost:6060", nil))
			}()
			// Your application code here
		}
		```

	3. Access the Profiles: Open a web browser and navigate to http://localhost:6060/debug/pprof/.
	   You’ll see links to various profiles such as:

		/debug/pprof/heap: Memory allocation profile.
		/debug/pprof/profile: CPU profile.
		/debug/pprof/goroutine: Goroutines information.
		/debug/pprof/block: Blocking profile.

	4. Generate Profiles with Command Line: Use the go tool pprof command to analyze and visualize
	   profiles. For example:
		```bash
		go tool pprof http://localhost:6060/debug/pprof/profile
		```

	5. Save Profiles for Offline Analysis: You can save profiling data to a file and analyze it later:
		```bash
		curl -o cpu.prof http://localhost:6060/debug/pprof/profile
		go tool pprof cpu.prof
		```
*/

// NOTE: Visualizing the Profiles:
/*
	Once you have profiling data, you can use tools like:
	Web Interface: Use go tool pprof with -http to serve a web-based UI:
	```bash
	go tool pprof -http=:8080 cpu.prof
	```

	Graphviz: Install Graphviz to create visual call graphs.
*/

// NOTE: Example Use Case:
/*
	Suppose your application is running slower than expected. By using pprof:

	1. Start profiling the application.
	2. Look at the flame graph or CPU profile to identify hot spots in the code.
	3. Optimize the identified bottlenecks.
	4. Rerun the profiling to confirm improvements.
*/

// NOTE: Conclusion:
/*
	pprof is an essential tool for performance tuning in Go.
	It provides deep insights into application behavior, helping developers optimize
	resource usage and resolve performance bottlenecks.

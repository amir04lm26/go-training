// NOTE: Best Practices for Go Development
/*
	Adhering to best practices in Go development not only improves the quality of your code
	but also enhances maintainability, readability, and performance.
	Here are some key best practices to follow:
*/

// NOTE: 1. Use Go Modules
/*
	•	Initialize Go Modules: Always use Go modules for dependency management.
		Start by running go mod init <module-name> to create a go.mod file.
	•	Keep Dependencies Updated: Regularly run go get -u to update your dependencies.
*/

// NOTE: 2. Write Idiomatic Go Code
/*
	•	Naming Conventions: Use clear and descriptive names for variables, functions, and types.
		Follow Go’s naming conventions (e.g., use CamelCase for exported names).
	•	Error Handling: Handle errors explicitly. Go’s error handling is straightforward;
		always check for errors returned by functions.

	```go
	result, err := someFunction()
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}
	```
*/

// NOTE: 3. Organize Code Effectively
/*
	•	Package Structure: Organize your code into packages that encapsulate related functionality.
		Keep packages small and focused.
	•	Avoid Circular Dependencies: Ensure that packages do not depend on each other in a circular
		manner.
*/

// NOTE: 4. Use Concurrency Wisely
/*
	•	Goroutines: Leverage goroutines for concurrent tasks but be mindful of potential race
		conditions.
	•	Channels: Use channels to communicate between goroutines safely and avoid shared state
		whenever possible.
*/

// NOTE: Write Tests
/*
	•	Unit Tests: Write tests for your functions using the testing package.
		Use table-driven tests for cleaner and more maintainable test cases.

	```go
	func TestMyFunction(t *testing.T) {
		tests := []struct {
			input    int
			expected int
		}{
			{1, 2},
			{2, 3},
		}

		for _, test := range tests {
			result := MyFunction(test.input)
			if result != test.expected {
				t.Errorf("Expected %d, got %d", test.expected, result)
			}
		}
	}

	•	Benchmark Tests: Use benchmarks to measure the performance of your functions.
	```
*/

// NOTE: Document Your Code
/*
	•	Comments: Write comments for your code, especially for public functions and complex logic.
		Use Go’s conventions for documentation comments to generate documentation.

		```go
		// Hello returns a greeting message.
		//* Hello returns a greeting message.
		func Hello(name string) string {
			return "Hello, " + name
		}
		```
*/

// NOTE: 7. Optimize Performance
/*
	•	Profiling: Use Go’s built-in profiling tools (pprof) to analyze your application’s
		performance and identify bottlenecks.
	•	Memory Management: Avoid unnecessary allocations and use slices effectively.
		Consider using sync.Pool for reusing objects.

*/

// NOTE: 8. Follow Code Formatting Guidelines
/*
	•	Use gofmt: Automatically format your Go code using gofmt or integrate it into your editor.
		This ensures consistent style across your codebase.
*/

// NOTE: 9. Keep Learning and Adapting
/*
	•	Stay Updated: Follow Go community updates, new features, and best practices.
		Join forums, read blogs, and participate in Go meetups or conferences.
*/

// NOTE: Key Takeaways:
/*
	•	Go Modules: Always use modules for dependency management.
	•	Idiomatic Code: Write clear and idiomatic Go code.
	•	Organized Structure: Organize your code into well-defined packages.
	•	Concurrency: Use goroutines and channels wisely.
	•	Testing: Write unit and benchmark tests to ensure code reliability.
	•	Documentation: Document your code for better understanding and maintenance.
	•	Performance Optimization: Profile and optimize your code.
	•	Code Formatting: Use gofmt for consistent code style.
	•	Continuous Learning: Stay updated with Go developments.
